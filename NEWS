• The license has been changed to a liberal MIT license instead of
  GPLv3.

• There is now a command-line option to disable the peer address
  bootstrapping. Along with a new option to make it accept advertised
  addresses in the local address range this can be used to create a
  private internal network on a LAN. Many thanks to William A.
  Kennington III for this feature.

• The proof-of-work difficulty for a new address can now be specified
  when running notbit-keygen. The difficulty will be used to avoid
  wasting time trying to decrypt messages with insufficient
  proof-of-work. The default value is now 2 instead of 1 which matches
  PyBitmessage.

• Some bugs have been fixed where Notbit may have been using an
  insufficient proof-of-work depending on chance. It was also
  incorrectly storing the proof-of-work settings for public keys that
  are requested from peers.

• Some Linuxisms have been removed to make it more portable to other
  Unices. It has been tested on OpenBSD.

• When receiving a message it will use the label of the keys as the
  name in the email to make it easier to identify who sent the
  message.

• It now supports searching for the bootstrap servers via DNS.
  Previously it was only using a hard-coded list in the source code.

• Keys that are marked as disabled by manually editing the keys.dat
  file and restarting notbit will now be ignored.

• If Notbit creates the maildir, it will now also create the cur
  directory. This was apparently causing problems when using Notbit
  with Mutt.
